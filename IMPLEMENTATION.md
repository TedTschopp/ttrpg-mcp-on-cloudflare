# TTRPG GM Tools - MCP Server
# Server Implementation Notes

## Architecture

This MCP server is built entirely with static files that can be hosted on GitHub Pages:

### File Structure
- `mcp.json` - Main MCP manifest with server metadata
- `api/tools.json` - Tool definitions and schemas
- `api/resources.json` - Resource definitions
- `api/prompts.json` - Prompt templates
- `_data/*.json` - Source data for generators

### How It Works

1. **Static Data**: All TTRPG data (encounters, names, etc.) is stored in JSON files in `_data/`
2. **Jekyll Processing**: Jekyll/Liquid templates process the data at build time
3. **MCP Endpoints**: The API files define MCP-compliant tool schemas
4. **Client Integration**: MCP clients read the manifest and tool definitions

### Limitations

Since GitHub Pages only supports static hosting:
- **No server-side logic**: All generation must happen client-side
- **No real-time data**: Data is static until the site is rebuilt
- **No state management**: Each request is independent

### Implementation Strategy

For a true MCP server, the client (like Claude Desktop) would:
1. Read the tool schemas from `api/tools.json`
2. Fetch data from the `_data` JSON files
3. Implement the generation logic using the provided data
4. Return results to the AI model

### Alternative: Proxy Server

For full MCP functionality, you could create a separate proxy server that:
- Reads from these static GitHub Pages endpoints
- Implements the actual generation logic
- Provides proper MCP protocol responses

Example proxy architecture:
```
[MCP Client] → [Proxy Server] → [GitHub Pages Data]
                     ↓
              Generation Logic
```

### Future Enhancements

1. **Add more data**:
   - More encounter types
   - Additional name cultures
   - Expanded treasure tables
   - More plot hooks

2. **Create generation examples**:
   - Add sample JavaScript generation code
   - Provide Python reference implementation
   - Document generation algorithms

3. **Improve schemas**:
   - Add more detailed validation
   - Include examples in tool schemas
   - Better error descriptions

4. **Add resources**:
   - Full data dumps as resources
   - Reference tables
   - Rule summaries

## Data Format Notes

### Encounters
Organized by: environment → difficulty → array of encounters
Each encounter has: name, creatures, description

### Names
Organized by: race → gender → array of names

### Locations
Organized by: type → prefixes/suffixes
Names generated by combining prefix + suffix

### Personality Traits
Flat arrays of: traits, ideals, bonds, flaws, quirks

### Treasure
Organized by: type (individual/hoard) → CR range → currency dice

### Weather
Organized by: climate → season (if applicable) → array of descriptions

### Plot Hooks
Organized by: theme → array of hooks
